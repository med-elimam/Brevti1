You must fix Replit publishing health-check failures and prepare the repo for exporting to any hosting with minimal changes.

Context:
- Express server in server/index.ts.
- Publishing fails because health checks on "/" time out or require specific headers/status codes.
- The app must respond FAST on "/" during startup. No expensive work on "/" or before listen.
- DB seeding and any heavy init must NOT block readiness.
- Also ensure persistence: SQLite + uploads should remain stable (vm deployment is desired on Replit, but code must not assume Replit).

Hard requirements:
1) Make "/" and "/health" return immediately in < 10ms:
   - Must be plain text "ok"
   - Must set Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
   - Must set Cache-Control: no-store
   - Must NOT depend on any middleware, DB, or async init.
   - Must return status 200 always.

2) Add readiness endpoint "/ready":
   - Returns 200 only after routes + db are initialized successfully.
   - Returns 503 before readiness.
   - Health checks should keep using "/" but "/ready" should exist for diagnostics.

3) Ensure no middleware delays the root endpoint:
   - Register "/" and "/health" BEFORE any app.use middleware.
   - Ensure no global middleware intercepts them.
   - Add a small middleware guard: if path is "/" or "/health" bypass everything.

4) Fix startup flow:
   - app.listen must start quickly.
   - Move initializeApp() so it never blocks the event loop before listen.
   - Seed DB asynchronously AFTER server is listening, and never block "/".
   - If seedDatabase is async, await it inside a background async function but do not block the process from serving "/" immediately.

5) Ensure PORT binding is correct for Replit:
   - Use process.env.PORT and listen on 0.0.0.0.
   - No hard-coded port for production.

6) Add structured logs:
   - On startup log timestamps: server listening, middleware ready, routes registered, db ready.
   - On every request to "/" log duration if > 50ms.

7) Prepare for export to another host:
   - Add .env.example with required variables.
   - Ensure API base URL usage is via env on mobile.
   - Ensure no Replit-only paths break local run.

Deliverables:
- Commit changes to server/index.ts and any needed files.
- Provide final explanation of what was changed and why publishing will pass.
- Ensure "Republish" succeeds.
