Update requests (must implement):

A) Upgrade Expo SDK:
- Upgrade this Expo project from SDK 54 to SDK 55.
- Fix all breaking changes and ensure it runs in Expo Go SDK 55.
- Update dependencies accordingly and ensure `npx expo start` works.

B) App name + branding:
- Change the app name (Arabic) to: "بريفتي"
- Update app.json / app.config.js, display name, and any internal titles.
- Add a small fixed footer text on EVERY screen (bottom center):
  "Mohamed el imam"
  It must be visible on all pages without covering content.
- Keep full Arabic UI + RTL.

C) PDF real curriculum system (Brevet/BEM):
Goal: Add a feature to import real PDF curriculum/exams, then automatically extract lessons + generate exercises + answers + explanations, and store them in SQLite.

Implementation requirements:
1) Add a new screen: /pdf-library
   - List imported PDFs (name, date, size)
   - Button: "إضافة PDF" (pick document from phone)
   - Use expo-document-picker to import PDFs

2) Add a backend service (recommended: Node.js + Express inside the Replit project):
   - Endpoint POST /api/pdf/ingest
     Input: PDF file
     Output: structured JSON with:
       subjects[], lessons[], exercises[]
   - Use a PDF text extractor (pdf-parse or similar). If the PDF is scanned images, include OCR fallback (tesseract.js or a simple notice to the user that OCR is needed).

3) AI extraction + generation:
   - After extracting text, split it into sections/lessons with headings.
   - Generate for each lesson:
     - Summary
     - Key points
     - Common mistakes
     - 10 MCQ exercises with:
       question, 4 options, correct option index, explanation
   - Return as JSON, and the mobile app inserts it into SQLite tables (subjects/lessons/exercises).

4) Offline-first:
   - After ingestion, all generated lessons and exercises must be available offline from SQLite.

5) Safety + quality:
   - Do not hallucinate content when text extraction fails. If extraction is incomplete, show an error in Arabic and ask the user to upload a clearer PDF.
   - Keep questions aligned with the extracted content.

D) UI updates:
- Add a menu entry on Dashboard: "مكتبة PDF"
- Add another screen /about showing:
  "تم تطوير وتنفيذ هذا التطبيق بواسطة محمد الإمام - Mohamed El Imam"

Deliver working code + README explaining how to run mobile + backend locally in Replit.
