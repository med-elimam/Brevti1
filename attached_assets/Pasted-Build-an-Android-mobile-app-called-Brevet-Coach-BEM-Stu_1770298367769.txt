Build an Android mobile app called "Brevet Coach" (BEM Study Companion) using React Native + Expo + TypeScript.

Core idea:
A complete offline-first study planner for the Brevet exam. It generates a personalized study plan based on the exam date, tracks study sessions with a focus timer (Pomodoro), offers lessons + exercises with instant correction, schedules spaced revision automatically, and shows analytics to identify weak topics and recommend what to study next.

Tech stack (must use):
- Expo React Native (TypeScript)
- expo-router for navigation
- expo-sqlite for local database (no external backend)
- AsyncStorage only for small settings
- Basic charts for analytics (react-native-chart-kit or any lightweight chart lib)
- Clean UI, Arabic-friendly (RTL optional, but labels can be Arabic)

Data model (SQLite tables):
1) subjects(id, name, color)
2) lessons(id, subject_id, title, summary, importance_points, common_mistakes)
3) study_sessions(id, subject_id, lesson_id, start_time, end_time, duration_minutes, focus_rating_1_5, notes)
4) exercises(id, lesson_id, difficulty, question, options_json, correct_index, explanation)
5) attempts(id, exercise_id, chosen_index, is_correct, time_spent_seconds, created_at)
6) review_queue(id, lesson_id, next_review_date, interval_days, ease_factor, last_result) 
7) settings(id, exam_date, daily_minutes_goal, pomodoro_work, pomodoro_break)

Seed data:
On first run, auto-create:
- Subjects: Math, Arabic, French, Science, History/Geography (you can label them in Arabic too)
- For each subject: at least 5 lessons with short summaries
- For each lesson: at least 3 multiple-choice exercises with explanations

Screens (expo-router routes):
1) /onboarding
- Pick exam date
- Pick daily study goal (minutes/day)
- Pick Pomodoro settings (work/break)
- Finish -> go to Dashboard

2) / (Dashboard)
- Show days left to exam
- Show Today plan: recommended lesson(s) to study today
- Quick actions: Start Focus Session, Exercises, Plan, Analytics
- Show progress per subject (percent)

3) /plan
- Weekly plan view (7 days)
- Auto-generate tasks from remaining lessons + review queue based on available time
- Allow user to mark a task done

4) /timer
- Pomodoro timer (start/pause/stop)
- Before start: select subject + lesson
- After stop: ask focus rating (1–5) + optional notes
- Save as a study_session

5) /subjects
- List subjects
- Tap -> /subjects/[id] to see lessons list and progress

6) /lessons/[id]
- Show summary, importance points, common mistakes
- Buttons: Start Timer for this lesson, Do Exercises for this lesson, Mark Lesson Completed

7) /exercises
- Filters: subject, lesson, difficulty
- Start a quiz session (5–10 questions)
- For each question: pick option, show correct/incorrect + short explanation
- Save attempts

8) /mock
- Mock exam mode: timed quiz (e.g., 30 questions random across subjects)
- End -> score + breakdown by subject/lesson + weakest topics

9) /analytics
- Study time chart (last 7 days)
- Accuracy chart (correct vs wrong)
- Weak lessons list (based on low accuracy + long time since last review)
- Button "Recommend what to study next" -> show top 3 lessons with reasons

Core logic requirements:
A) Recommendation engine:
Compute a priority score for each lesson:
- + if last review is old (days since last session)
- + if exercise accuracy is low
- + if lesson not completed
Return top lessons for "Today plan".

B) Spaced repetition:
When a lesson is completed or reviewed, update review_queue:
- If correct/strong: increase interval_days (1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 14 ...)
- If weak: decrease interval and schedule sooner
Use a simple SM-2-like approach (ease_factor optional, keep it simple and stable).

C) Progress calculation:
Lesson completed contributes to subject progress.
Also show mastery from attempts accuracy.

UX requirements:
- Simple, clean, responsive
- Works fully offline
- Provide an in-app "Reset demo data" button in Settings (danger zone)

Deliverables:
- Full working Expo app that runs with: npm install && npx expo start
- Include clear README with steps to run on Android (Expo Go) and how to reset data.
- Keep code organized: /app routes, /db for sqlite helpers, /lib for recommendation logic, /components for UI.

Make sure the app compiles and the main flows work:
Onboarding -> Dashboard -> Timer -> Save session -> Analytics updates.
Exercises -> Attempts saved -> Recommendation changes.

Language and Attribution Requirements:
- The entire application interface must be in Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic) with clear, student-friendly wording.
- The layout should support right-to-left (RTL) direction.
- The application must clearly display that it was developed and implemented by:
"تم تطوير وتنفيذ هذا التطبيق بواسطة محمد الإمام - Mohamed El Imam"
- This attribution should appear in the About section and optionally in the splash screen or settings page.
