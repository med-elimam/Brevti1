You are working inside my existing Expo + Express (TypeScript) monorepo on Replit.
Your job: prepare a clean, exportable “production-ready” version that I can download as ZIP and deploy the server to Railway/Fly with minimal edits.

GOALS (must all be done):
A) Branding + Splash assets
B) In-app first screen showing logo then continue
C) Single environment variable for API base URL (so moving server host changes only 1 value)
D) Repo ready to export & deploy on Railway/Fly (no Replit-specific assumptions)
E) Keep current features (admin, sources/pdf uploads, AI tools, quizzes, exams, lessons). Do not remove anything.

-------------------------
A) BRANDING ASSETS
1) Create folder: assets/branding/
2) Add these files inside (create them if missing or copy from existing if already present):
   - assets/branding/icon.png (1024x1024)
   - assets/branding/adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024)
   - assets/branding/splash.png (1242x2436)
   - assets/branding/favicon.png (48x48)
   (If you cannot generate images, create placeholders and clearly tell me; but prefer using existing logo image already in repo if available.)

3) Update Expo config (app.json OR app.config.js; keep whichever the repo uses):
   - expo.name = "Brevti"
   - expo.slug = "brevti"
   - expo.scheme = "brevti"
   - expo.icon points to ./assets/branding/icon.png
   - expo.splash.image points to ./assets/branding/splash.png
   - expo.splash.resizeMode = "contain"
   - expo.splash.backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
   - android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage points to ./assets/branding/adaptive-icon.png
   - android.adaptiveIcon.backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
   - web.favicon points to ./assets/branding/favicon.png

4) IMPORTANT: Set stable identifiers (do NOT change later):
   - android.package = "com.brevti.app" (or a clean unique value; pick one and keep it)
   - ios.bundleIdentifier = "com.brevti.app"

-------------------------
B) FIRST SCREEN INSIDE APP (NOT the native splash)
1) Add a screen component that shows the logo centered for ~1.2 seconds then routes to the main home.
2) Use expo-router if the project uses it:
   - Create app/splash.tsx (or the correct router folder in this repo).
   - It must show the logo image from assets/branding/icon.png on white background.
   - After 1200ms, router.replace("/") (or the correct main route).
3) Make splash screen the FIRST route:
   - Ensure app entry opens /splash first, then continues.
   - Do not break existing navigation.

-------------------------
C) ONE ENV VAR FOR API BASE URL
1) Add env variable support for the mobile app:
   - EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
2) Find where the mobile app currently calls the server (fetch to /api/...) and centralize to one helper:
   - Create something like src/config/api.ts exporting:
     export const API_BASE_URL = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL ?? "http://localhost:5000";
3) Replace all hard-coded domains with API_BASE_URL.
4) Ensure it works for:
   - Local dev
   - Replit workspace
   - External server on Railway/Fly

5) Add .env.example at repo root:
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ADMIN_TOKEN=change_me
   OPENAI_API_KEY=optional_if_used
   (include whatever env vars server needs; keep it accurate)

-------------------------
D) SERVER READY FOR RAILWAY/FLY
1) Ensure server listens on process.env.PORT and 0.0.0.0.
2) Ensure uploads path is relative + stable:
   - Use ./uploads
   - Ensure directory exists on startup (mkdirp)
3) Ensure SQLite path is stable:
   - Use ./data/app.db
   - Ensure ./data exists on startup
4) Ensure CORS remains correct.
5) Add production scripts for server:
   - package.json should have:
     "start": "node dist/server/index.js" OR "tsx server/index.ts" depending on setup.
     Provide a clean "build" step if needed.
6) Add README DEPLOY section:
   - How to deploy to Railway
   - How to deploy to Fly
   - What env vars to set
   - What volume/persistent storage is needed for data/app.db and uploads (mention both)
   Keep it short but correct.

7) IMPORTANT: Do NOT force Replit-specific deploy settings. Repo must run anywhere.

-------------------------
E) ZIP EXPORT PREP
1) Ensure repo runs with:
   - npm install
   - npm run dev (if exists)
   - npm run start (production)
2) Ensure there are no absolute paths or Replit-only URLs.
3) Make a final checklist at the end: what changed + where.

-------------------------
OUTPUT REQUIRED
After you implement:
- List every changed/added file
- Give me exact steps to:
  1) Download ZIP
  2) Deploy server to Railway/Fly
  3) Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL in the mobile build
  4) Build AAB/APK with EAS (commands)

DO NOT:
- Remove features
- Rewrite architecture
- Add new frameworks
- Make fake claims. Verify by running the app and server in the workspace and confirming no build errors.
