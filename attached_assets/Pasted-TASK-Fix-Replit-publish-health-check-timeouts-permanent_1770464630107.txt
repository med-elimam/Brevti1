TASK: Fix Replit publish health-check timeouts permanently.

CONTEXT:
Publishing fails because health checks hit "/" and time out. Our server registers "/" and "/health", but we call initializeApp() immediately after app.listen(), and initializeApp performs heavy synchronous work (middleware + static + routes + seed + fs reads). That blocks the event loop so "/" doesn't respond fast enough during startup.

GOAL:
1) "/" must respond immediately with status 200 and plain text "ok" ALWAYS, even while the app is still initializing.
2) "/health" must respond immediately with status 200 and plain text "ok" ALWAYS.
3) Defer ALL expensive initialization (register middleware/routes/static, db open, seedDatabase, manifest handling, templates reading) to the next tick using setImmediate / setTimeout, so health checks never get blocked.
4) Add a readiness flag:
   - Start with isReady=false
   - After init completes, isReady=true
   - Add "/api/ready" returning { ok:true, ready:isReady, uptime_ms, ts } (fast).
5) Ensure seedDatabase never blocks startup:
   - run it in setTimeout(() => seedDatabase(), 0)
   - if it does large work, chunk it or make it conditional and fast (already checks tables empty).
6) Ensure we listen on 0.0.0.0 and process.env.PORT.
7) Confirm publish uses VM deployment (persistent FS), but the main issue here is health-check speed.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (server/index.ts):
- Keep these at top BEFORE app.listen:
  app.get("/", ...send("ok"))
  app.get("/health", ...send("ok"))
  app.get("/api/ready", ...)

- Start server:
  const server = app.listen(port, "0.0.0.0", () => log(...));

- DO NOT call initializeApp() directly inside listen callback.
  Instead:
    setImmediate(() => initializeApp().catch(console.error));

- In initializeApp():
  - Wrap heavy blocks (templates fs.readFileSync, static-build manifest routing, require("./routes"), registerRoutes, error handler, seedDatabase) inside try/catch but DO NOT block readiness endpoints.
  - Set isReady=true at the very end after routes are registered.
  - Seed DB in background with setTimeout.

- IMPORTANT: No fs.readFileSync or require-heavy work should run before the event loop can answer "/" quickly.

After changes:
- Run the repl and curl "/" repeatedly during startup to verify instant response.
- Publish again.
